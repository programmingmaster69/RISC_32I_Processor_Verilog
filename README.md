# RISC_32I_Processor_Verilog

A 32-bit RISC processor (RV32I-style) implemented in Verilog — with a pipelined architecture, modular RTL, instruction & data memory, register file, control units, forwarding logic, and a testbench for functional verification.  

---

## Features 

- 32-bit RISC core (based on a classic 32-bit instruction set architecture, similar to RISC‑V RV32I) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Modular RTL: separated into sub-modules for ALU, control unit, instruction and data memory, register file, pipeline registers (IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB), forwarding unit, etc. (see file list) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Support for pipelined execution — enabling better instruction throughput than simple single-cycle designs.  
- Instruction memory and data memory modules. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Register file, ALU, control logic, multiplexers, and pipeline control for proper instruction flow. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Testbench (`tb.v`) to simulate and verify correct behavior of the processor. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Design Overview

### Data Path & Pipeline

- **Fetch (IF)**: Instruction fetched from `Instruction_Memory.v` using program counter (from `Program_Counter.v` + `Adder.v` for PC+4 or branch target).  
- **Decode (ID)**: Instruction parsed (opcode, registers, immediate values) via `extractor.v` / `parser.v`; control signals generated by `Control_Unit.v`; register operands fetched from `registerFile.v`.  
- **Execute (EX)**: ALU performs arithmetic/logic operations (`ALU_64_bit.v` + `ALU_Control.v`); branch decisions if any; forwarding logic (`ForwardingUnit.v`) handles data hazards.  
- **Memory Access (MEM)**: For load/store instructions, `Data_Memory.v` is accessed.  
- **Write-Back (WB)**: Results are written back to the register file via pipeline registers `WBRegister.v`.  

### Control & Hazard Handling

- Control signals (ALU operation, memory read/write, register write enable, etc.) are generated by the control unit.  
- Forwarding unit helps resolve read-after-write (RAW) hazards, preventing pipeline stalls when possible.  
- Modular design makes it easier to extend the core (e.g. add new instructions, add hazard detection & stall logic, branch prediction, etc.).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Verilog simulator (e.g. Icarus Verilog for open-source, or commercial tools like ModelSim / QuestaSim / VCS / Riviera‑PRO)  
- (Optionally) waveform viewer such as GTKWave. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  

### Clone & Simulate

```bash
git clone https://github.com/programmingmaster69/RISC_32I_Processor_Verilog.git
cd RISC_32I_Processor_Verilog
```
Then compile and run the testbench. Example with Icarus-Verilog + GTKWave:
```bash
iverilog -o riscv32i_core *.v tb.v
vvp riscv32i_core
